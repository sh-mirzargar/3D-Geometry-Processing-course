Implementation:

We approached the problems as the following:
1- Iterating over all the triangle indices
2-for each triangle fetch its vertices
3-Then for each triangle, store the iso-value of its virtices and vertex points in two vectors
4-We use an utility function, "find triangle_type_fucntion", which returns 1 if all the vertices have positive iso values andreturns 8 if all virtices have negative value and etc.
5-If the signs are different, use linear interpolation based on the iso-values to compute the edge that passes through that triangle  
To compute the linear interpolation we have used the formula from the link below(slide 20):

6- Finally segment points are added to the "segment_points" vectors according to the quidelines

Sample output:
We have attached some outputs for the regular mesh 3 and all the implicit functions. You can find them as sample_{1,2,3,4} in order of implicit functions in the combobox.
